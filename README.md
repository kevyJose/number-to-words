# Number to Words Converter (Java Web App)

This project is a lightweight Java-based web application that converts a numerical currency value (e.g. `123.45`) into its English word representation (e.g. `ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-THREE DOLLARS AND FORTY-FIVE CENTS`). It includes a custom-built algorithm and a simple web interface served using Java's built-in HTTP server.
